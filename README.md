## Installation

To run Genesis locally on your machine, follow the steps below.

### Prerequisites

Make sure you have the following installed on your system:

- **Node.js** (v14.x or later)
- **MongoDB** (For local development, or use a cloud MongoDB service like [MongoDB Atlas](https://www.mongodb.com/cloud/atlas))
- **Firebase Project** (for authentication setup)

### Setting up the Project

1. **Clone the repository**:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/genesis.git
   cd genesis
   ```

2. **Install the frontend dependencies**:
   ```bash
   cd frontend
   npm install
   ```

3. **Install the backend dependencies**:
   ```bash
   cd backend
   npm install
   ```

4. **Setup environment variables**:
   - Create a `.env` file in both the **frontend** and **backend** directories. 
   - Add necessary environment variables such as Firebase credentials, MongoDB connection string, and any API keys required.

   Example for the **backend** `.env`:
   ```bash
   MONGODB_URI=your_mongodb_connection_string
   PORT=5000
   FIREBASE_API_KEY=your_firebase_api_key
   ```

   Example for the **frontend** `.env`:
   ```bash
   REACT_APP_FIREBASE_API_KEY=your_firebase_api_key
   REACT_APP_FIREBASE_AUTH_DOMAIN=your_firebase_auth_domain
   REACT_APP_FIREBASE_PROJECT_ID=your_firebase_project_id
   ```

5. **Run the backend**:
   ```bash
   cd backend
   npm start
   ```
   This will start the backend server on `http://localhost:5000`.

6. **Run the frontend**:
   ```bash
   cd frontend
   npm run dev
   ```
   This will start the frontend server on `http://localhost:5173`.
